Steps for Assesment test:--

1)first of all, i created 3 directories(f1,f2 and f3) and a python file (mainpy.py)
and inside mainpy.py i have written the main code there.

2)Inside floder1(f1),file is genrated in every single second and every second file is stored in database with the "status 0" as well.(database has two columns "text1","status")


3)then after every 5 seconds all the files will move from folder(f1) to folder(f2).

4)now all files will move from folder(2) to folder(3) after every 10 second and then inside database the values of "status" column will update from 0 to 1.
